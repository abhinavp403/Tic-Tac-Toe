# Tic-Tac-Toe

This was done as a refactoring project. I wrote the code in 2017 in Java. Since everything in Android has shifted to Kotlin, I went ahead and rewrote the code base in Kotlin. 
In short it's a tic-tac-toe game with a simple interface. There's no CPU to compete with, so it must be played between two real-world players.

Libraries used-  
1) ButterKnife (Dagger injection)
